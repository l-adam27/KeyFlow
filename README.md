## Inspiration:
  I got my inspirition on stream deck, i used to want to own one, but I realized 60 U$D was too much for some keys that I already have on a normal keyboard. I wanted to create something cheap but useful, and thats why I created KeyFlow. The idea of having a fast may to do something, without making confusion on your actual keyboard.
## Challenges:
  It was my firts experience with advanced programs like KiCad or making 3D models, I got really confused in the start but before watching some tutorials on youtube I figured all out.
  Besides that, im really proud of what I created.
